function [p1 n1 n2]=compute_spike_boundary(spike_ref,fs)
% COMPUTE_SPIKE_BOUNDARY - Function to detect spike endpoints
%
% Syntax:
%   [p1, n1, n2] = compute_spike_boundary(spike_ref, fs)
%
% Inputs:
%   spike_ref - 300 ms [10-60] Hz filtered spike segment with spike peak at
%               75 ms. The spike segment is considered as 75 ms preceding N1
%               and 22 ms succeeding N1.
%   fs - Sampling frequency in Hz.
%
% Outputs:
%   p1 - Onset of the spike.
%   n1 - Peak of the spike predicted by Janca detector.
%   n2 - End of the spike.
%
% Description:
%   This function identifies the onset (p1), peak (n1), and end (n2) of a spike
%   based on the provided spike reference signal and sampling frequency.
%   It utilizes peak detection algorithms to locate the relevant points.

% Notes:
%   - This code is for research purposes only. Contact the author for reuse
%     and bug reporting.
%   - If downsampling was not performed while running the Janca detector, you
%     can skip the spike peak identification portion.
%   - The code uses the `islocalmin` and `islocalmax` functions for peak detection.
%   - The prominence levels and window sizes are adjusted iteratively until the
%     desired points (p1, n1, n2) are found.
